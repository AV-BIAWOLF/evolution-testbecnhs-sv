# Moving Average Filter (Practice writing a testbench)
## Overview
This repository contains the RTL implementation and verification environment for a Moving Average Filter (MAF). A moving average filter is commonly used in digital signal processing to smooth a series of input data by calculating the average of a fixed number of previous inputs. This filter is useful in noise reduction and trend identification in various applications, such as data smoothing in communication systems.

## Key Features:
- Simoole parameterizable window size for calculating the moving average.
- RTL design using SystemVerilog.
  
## Verification Focus
The primary focus of this project is on developing and validating verification methodologies for digital designs. The testbench and verification environment are designed to provide thorough testing coverage of the moving average filter. 
This repository presents testbenches increasing in difficulty.

### Tools and Methodologies
- RTL Design: Verilog/SystemVerilog.
- Testbench: Built using SystemVerilog
